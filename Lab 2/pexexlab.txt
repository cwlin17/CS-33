Gather Instruction Traces:
-Typed: gdb --args ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-26.1 -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
	-Entered the gdb
	
-Typed: r
	-Ran the program
	
-Typed: break Ftimes
	-Set breakpoint at function Ftimes
	
-Typed: r -batch -eval '(print(* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
	-The program is run with the right arguments 
	
-Realized I didn't have automatic assembly instruction output
-Typed: set disassemble-next-line on
	-Automatically prints out assembly instructions each time you stop 
	
-Reran the program

-Typed: info registers $rdx
	-Checks what's in register %rdx
	-Value was 0 because the first instruction of the function hadn't been run yet
	
-Typed: si
	-Steps into the next machine instruction
	
-Typed: info registers $[register_name] 
	-Prints the state of a specific register

-Continusously used si and info registers $[register_name] to trace through the program

Examine Integer Overflow Handling:
-Typed: gcc -c -O2 testovf.c; objdump -d testovf.o
	-Compiles the function with -O2 and outputs assembly language
-Typed: gcc -c -O2 -fwrapv testovf.c; objdump -d testovf.o
	-Compiles the function with signed wraparound on overflow enabled and outputs assembly language
-Typed: gcc -c -O2 -fsanitize=undefined testovf.c; objdump -d testovf.o
	-Compiles the function with the -fsanitize=undefined flag, which checks for undefined behavior. Also outputs assmebly language.
